# PCSO IMAP APPLICATION DATABASE


Welcome to the Information Management Prerequisite Project repository! This project is designed as a prerequisite assignment for our Information Management course.

## Overview

The Individual Medical Assistance Program (IMAP) is a program that provides financial assistance to individuals with health-related problems to augment their funds in partnership with government and private hospitals, health facilities, medicine retailers, and other partners. The applicants search for financial assistance resources, as medical assistance can be expensive, submit a form, and comply with the needed documents for the PCSO IMAP. The form will consist of personal, household, and application details to provide information about the applicantâ€™s background. 
A complete database system must be developed to manage Individual Medical Assistance Program (IMAP) applications, which are managed by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). The objective is to make a system database of IMAP applications to protect sensitive personal and medical data; the database design will include strong data organization, effective query processing, and strict security measures. Ultimately, this system aims to ensure timely and targeted support for individuals in need of medical assistance by making a system of application records and tracking disbursements
